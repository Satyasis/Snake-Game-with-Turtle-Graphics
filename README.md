# Snake-Game-with-Turtle-Graphics
The game features intuitive controls, smooth gameplay mechanics, and basic collision detection. Players control a snake that grows in length as it consumes food objects while avoiding collisions with walls and its own tail. The game includes score tracking and ends when the snake collides with itself or the boundaries of the game window.
